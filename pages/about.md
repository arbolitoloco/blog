Hi, I'm [Laura](https://laura.rochaprado.com/), a crafty scientist who loves to code.

This is a place (and an outlet) for random thoughts, guides, tutorials, tips, tricks, reviews, or anything really related to programming, web development, biodiversity informatics, and technology. I will try to post here anything that I learn (or that I find on StackOverflow haha) that might be useful for others.
