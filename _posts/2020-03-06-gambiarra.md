What is this mysterious words that I chose to name my blog?
Gambiarra is a portuguese word that means workaround, improvisiation, hack, or fix, but usually in a flimsy way. Ever watch MacGyver solve complex problems using nothing but a paper clip and tape? That would be the most state of gambiarra ever achieved.
I chose this word because this is my life as a biodiversity informatician: I'm a biologist turned programmer, who has to constantly run gambiarras to make things work. Hey, it might be ugly, but it works, OK?
The gambiarra is a celebration of Brazilian ingenuity, and this blog is a small sample of workarounds that I found (with the help of many anonymous internet helpers) to solve tech issues. Welcome! Please make yourself comfortable.
